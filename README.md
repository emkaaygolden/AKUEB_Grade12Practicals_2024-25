# AKUEB Grade 12 Practicals, 2024-25

This repository contains all the C++ practicals for the Aga Khan University Examination Board (AKUEB) Grade 12, academic year 2024-25. Each practical aligns with specific Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) provided in the curriculum. The code is simple, clean, and easy to understand, making it ideal for students and educators.

## Structure
Each practical is stored in its own folder, named after the corresponding SLO (e.g., `SLO_12.1.2`). Inside each folder, you'll find:
- **`main.cpp`**: The C++ code file for the specific practical.

## Practical Topics Covered
### Topic 12: Control Structures
1. **SLO 12.1.2**: Programs for `if`, `if-else`, and `else-if`.
2. **SLO 12.1.3**: Program using nested `if` statement.
3. **SLO 12.1.5**: Program using `switch` statement.
4. **SLO 12.2.2**: Program using `for` loop.
5. **SLO 12.2.3**: Program using `while` loop.
6. **SLO 12.2.4**: Program using `do-while` loop.

### Topic 13: Arrays and Strings
7. **SLO 13.1.7**: Program to find the highest, lowest, and average values in a one-dimensional array.
8. **SLO 13.2.5**: Program for addition, subtraction, and multiplication of 4x4 matrices.
9. **SLO 13.3.3**: Program demonstrating string operations (`strcpy`, `strcat`, `strlen`, `strcmp`).

### Topic 14: Functions
10. **SLO 14.1.5**: Functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
11. **SLO 14.1.6**: Function to calculate the area of geometric shapes.
12. **SLO 14.1.7**: Function to calculate the volume of 3D shapes.
13. **SLO 14.1.9**: Function to calculate factorial.
14. **SLO 14.1.8**: Function to calculate the average of numbers.

### Topic 15: Pointers
15. **SLO 15.1.5**: Program using `&` operator to return memory address.
16. **SLO 15.1.6**: Program demonstrating pointer usage.

### Topic 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
17. **SLO 16.1.2**: Program with a class, data members, member functions, and objects.
18. **SLO 16.1.6**: Program demonstrating public and private access specifiers.
